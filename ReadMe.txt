Hi, that first version of ReadmeFile

This project worked and tested on Ubuntu 16.04 with using next libraries:
1. Boost
2. Armadillo
3. AlgLib

Programm development roadmap:
1. Solving and visualization of FEM worked on linear element
2. HDG-FEM scheme
3. Mesh constucting on complex geometries (triangle meshes)
4(5?). FVM for elliptic equations 
5. Time-dependent equations solving. Parabolic and Hyperbolic Eqautions
6...

-rectangle mesh solvers
-FVM for unsteady flows
